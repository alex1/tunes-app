This app is intended to help me keep track of, remember, and have access to various audio recordings. In my case, they are recordings of tunes that I am trying to learn on the fiddle, but I guess they can be anything.

The benefit of this app over something like iTunes is that you don't have worry about syncing between devices, or having your device with you. You can have access to your audio anywhere you can access the website, and the layout is intended to be plain and simple, on all devices, making it easier to listen to a single bit of audio repeatedly (helpful when trying to learn a tune on the fiddle).

Here are some features which I hope to implement:

Better organization of files in the Amazon S3 repository (group files by user)
Add a custom filter/tag functionality, for improved sorting/finding. In my case, it would be helpful to be able to tag tunes by what fiddle tuning they are played in, and sort based on that.
Sort alphabetically
